# jay [![CircleCI][badge]][circleci]

This project is a collection of commands that I find helpful. It's built using
the [oclif][] framework.

## Installation

This is a published NPM package, so you can install with yarn or whatever:

```
$ yarn add @jonallured/jay
# or
$ yarn global add @jonallured/jay
```

I used to just run this locally, like so:

```
$ c jay
$ npm link
$ asdf reshim
```

You don't always have to reshim, but if it doesn't link right, then that's
probably the issue.
