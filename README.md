# jay [![CircleCI][badge]][circleci]

This project is a collection of commands that I find helpful. It's built using
the [oclif][] framework.

## Installation

I just run this locally, so installing looks like this:

```
$ c jay
$ npm link
$ asdf reshim
```

You don't always have to reshim, but if it doesn't link right, then that's
probably the issue.
